            You are saving less than 20% of your monthly income. You should be
            following the golden rule of budgeting 50/20/30. 50% of your income
            should go to essentials, 20% to savings and 30% to personal
            expenses. You should consider increasing your savings.

            The cost of the purchase is more than 30% of your monthly income.
            You should consider a more affordable option or adjust your budget

              Since the cost of the purchase is more than 30% of your monthly
              income, consider saving up for the purchase. You can save up
              ${{saving_per_month|floatformat:2}} per month for 6 months or
              ${{savings_per_month|floatformat:2}} per month for 12 months. If
              the purchase is urgent, you can also finance the product
              responsibly with the store of your choice. Keep in mind, that a
              "want" purchase should not be more than 30% of your monthly
              income.
